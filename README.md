Sorry for the bad clarity

In this project we try to detect the potholes using yolov4, by training about 6000 images and storing them as backup files, this might a lot of time maybe few days time also, after measuring the accuracy, since all the weights have been saved, we can proceed with the live detection of potholes. 

This project uses the principle of Yolov4 and machinelearning methods to use the webcam.
